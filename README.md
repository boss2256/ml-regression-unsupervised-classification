# ML Regression, Unsupervised Learning, and Classification

## Summary

This project involves the application of various machine learning techniques including regression, unsupervised learning, and classification on diverse datasets. The objective is to demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze, predict, and derive insights from data in different contexts.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to explore the capabilities of machine learning in solving real-world problems across different domains. By applying regression to predict prices, unsupervised learning to cluster data, and classification to predict outcomes, the project showcases the versatility and power of machine learning techniques.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Apply regression analysis to estimate the prices of surveillance cameras.
- Use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster college data for better decision-making.
- Implement classification algorithms to predict college admission based on student scores.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis of the datasets.

## Project Components

### 1. Price of Surveillance Cameras Dataset (Regression Learning)
- **Substantive Issue:** Estimating the prices of security cameras based on their features.
- **Methodology:** Applied regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- **Results:** Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models with the best RMSE and adjusted RÂ² values.

### 2. College Dataset (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Substantive Issue:** Clustering colleges based on various features to aid students in their decision-making process.
- **Methodology:** Used K-Means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Results:** Identified clusters of colleges based on similarities, providing a clear grouping for potential students.

### 3. Admission Prediction (Classification)
- **Substantive Issue:** Predicting college admissions based on student scores.
- **Methodology:** Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models.
- **Results:** SVM achieved the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score among the models tested.

## Summary Findings

1. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Effective in predicting the prices of surveillance cameras.
   - Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - Successfully clustered colleges into meaningful groups.
   - PCA helped in visualizing the clusters effectively.

3. **Classification:**
   - SVM model was the most effective in predicting college admissions.
   - Logistic Regression and Random Forest also provided valuable insights.

## Recommendations

- **Surveillance Cameras:** Random Forest Regressor is recommended for price prediction due to its high accuracy.
